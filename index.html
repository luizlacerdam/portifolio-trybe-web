        I'm Luiz Lacerda, from Recife, Brazil. I use to say that I started my life when applied to be an exchange student. 
        I lived one year in Chama - New Mexico and it was a great year for me. 
        Since I came back from there I went to college earning an engineering degre where it was my first time studying codding. 
        Now I'm studying web development and CS.
